## TL;DR

### Option 1 (Start server + clients)

The following commands (ran from the **main folder**) will start the server and both clients (React + Angular) and open the browser
to both clients as well.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Option 2 (Start each component)

Start the server

```bash
cd server
npm install
npm start
```

Start the React client (Store)

```bash
cd client-react
npm install
npm start
```

Start the Angular client (Admin)

```bash
cd client-angular
npm install
ng serve --open
```
